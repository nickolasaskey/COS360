Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app that I chose to develop is an event tracking application; the user inputs the name of an event, the date in which the event occurs, and the time on that date that it will occur.  The application would then send a text message reminder to the user before the event starts to give them a heads up, as well as at the time in which the event is to start in case they missed or forgot about the first notification.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
It was important to implement 2 screens for the log-in process; one for existing users to log into their account, and one for new users who need to sign up for an account.  Whether they were new or existing, once they create or log into an account with the app, they are then taken to the main event tracking app screen.  This screen would show any events that the user has already created, as well as an option to add a new event to the existing list.  There is also an X button that appears on each of the events that allows the user to delete the event.  This would cause the app to remove the event from the list and also remove the reminder for the user.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I watched a lot of videos on the Android Studio website for Kotlin, as well as videos of experts on YouTube showing exactly how each aspect of Android Studio's application creation options interact with the UIs and other applications.  It is important to constantly test your work; if you happen to work for several hours and not test during that time, there is a good chance that the code will not work and it is much more challenging to find exactly where the issue started. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Debugging and Running the application on the provided emulator can help prevent a lot of headache.  Being able to see how the application will not only perform on an actual android device, but also how the UI that you created will appear to the user, is an incredibly useful tool for any application developer.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
There were several videos that I watched that did their programming in Java rather than Kotlin; overcoming this challenged me to learn what differences exist between the two programming languages and make updates to the code so that I could change the information to a programming language that better suited my individual skill. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe that I do best when it comes to appearance and design.  I find that my choices of color, text, and overall layout design are very strong; and while I may need a little assistance from the internet sometimes while actually writing code, I don't tend to struggle at all when I need to create a smooth UI that encapsulates all the data necessary without overloading the user with hundreds of buttons, textboxes, and editText files.
